This project runs Apache Airflow inside Docker, with PostgreSQL as the metadata database. It mounts your dags/ folder so your ETL script (e.g., ETLWeather.py) runs inside the Airflow environment.

Prerequisites:
  Install Docker Desktop 
  Ensure Docker Daemon is running

Initialize an Airflow project (inside your new folder in VS Code)
  Open VS Codeâ€™s terminal in your folder and run one of this for blank project: astro dev init
  (Creates the standard DAGs/plugins/dependencies structure.) 

Write your ETL code
You will find my code in AirflowETL -> dags -> __pychache__ -> ETLWeather.py

Make docker-compose.yml file before running project

Run Airflow locally:
  From your project directory: astro dev start
